# üè¶ One Big Exchange ‚Äì Consolidated Order Book

This project simulates receiving market data feeds from **multiple exchanges** and builds a **consolidated order book** per stock symbol.  
It merges data from different exchanges and serves the **top 5 levels** through a FastAPI backend.

‚úÖ This was built as part of an assignment for **CareEco Technologies**.

## üìå **Project Goal**

US equities (or any assets) can be traded on multiple exchanges.  
We want to:
- Merge top-of-the-book and order-based feeds from multiple exchanges
- Build a consolidated order book per symbol
- Serve top 5 levels, showing:
  - Bid Size, Bid Price, Offer Price, Offer Size
- Update live, as new data arrives

---


## ‚öô **How it works**

- We simulate **3 exchanges**: `ExchangeA`, `ExchangeB`, `ExchangeC`
- Each exchange sends random:
  - NEW_ORDER (with price, side, quantity)
  - CANCEL_ORDER
  - MODIFY_ORDER
- Backend merges these orders:
  - Same price across exchanges ‚Üí sum sizes
- Builds **top 5 bid/offer levels**, sorted properly
- Exposes a REST API:
  `GET /api/orderbook/AAPL`
